# Digital Multimeter - HID

This is a small project to be able to log and view measurements from my AXIOMET AX-594 multimeter.
The multimeter cable is a USB HID device with `vid_1244&pid_d237`.

The decoding implementation is based on this article: http://sigrok.org/wiki/Victor_protocol

Created in Angular 15 and Electron using node-hid library.
